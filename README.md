# vffdump
Tool to dump Wii .vff files.

Made by [marcan](https://github.com/marcan). The original link to the script is at [https://marcan.st/transf/vffdump.py](https://marcan.st/transf/vffdump.py).

This tool remained unfinished until the end of 2015, when someone asked marcan if he could make it better.
